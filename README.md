# Introduction
#### GuidedTours.js is a simple, lightweight library for creating guided tours in your apps and sites. We built it for our product docsie.io as current open source alternatives are either unmaintained, heavy, commercialized, or didn't do what we wanted them to do.  This is the simple alternative.

This is what it looks like on out site.

You can see a demo implemented in our own app by following this link. 

Guidedtours.js is configured using simple json format
